# TODO List

Things on this list are sorted by when I thought of them

- Generalize submission form for other game types
- Display rank changes on recent game view
- Store rank changes in games
    - Or recalculate them on the fly, maybe? Too expensive?
    - cacheing?
- Compare profiles
- Graphs!
- Spin router out into its own library
    - May not be worth it if we're gonna abandon redux anyway
    - Figure out why the initial location dispatch can't happen when middleware is installed
- Separate 2v2 and 1v1 leaderboards
	- HMMMMM
